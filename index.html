              The greatest advantage of Algebra University is definitely my
              colleagues who specialize in different areas of IT and the
              professors who are experienced not only in the academic sphere,

              My dad was the one who first noticed the program at Algebra
              University. He was the one who recognized the right timing and the
              potential of IT industry for me. Initially, I was preparing to get
              into the Faculty of Architecture in Zagreb.

            <p>
              I fell in love with video games after high school. I believe that
              the dualities they exhibit: between art and play, intellect and
              emotions, contemplation and agency, are the dualities we encounter
              in our everyday lives. In their ideal form, video games could be
              one of our best teachers of how to live.
