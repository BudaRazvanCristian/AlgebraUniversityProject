            Your time spent in higher education should not be just an
            intermezzo, a short break between the innocence of school life and
            the harsh future where hope that you will ever find a career you
            love slowly wanes.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than twenty years ago, we realized we have to do something
            about this. We knew we can and must offer something more than that.
            That is why Algebra opened its doors. Because of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are the reason we work hard every day to improve and perfect our
            offer. You are the reason we never compromise on quality. We want
            you to discover the best version of yourself during your time on
            Algebra University. To find a field of work you will be passionate
            about and become really good at it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course we take pride in all the awards and accolades received
            during the years. We are glad when others recognize our efforts. But
            our number one concern is deserving the trust you put in us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We chose our lecturers very carefully. They will be your guides on
            the journey toward graduation. Their mission is to give you useful,
            recent and applicable knowledge of their respective areas. To make
            you a true expert with shining career prospects. Each lecture is
            envisioned as a small but significant step toward that goal. Their
            passion will rub onto you if you let it.
          </p>
          <p>See you around the campus,</p>
          <h2 id="text-1">Your Algebra</h2>

            and short educational programmes in adult education, additional
            3.000 kids and young in Digital Academy and State Matura exam prep.

            our students as well as by all major software manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are located in historic CUC campus in the heart of Croatian
            capital Zagreb, while adult education and training programmes are

            Dubrovnik, as well as in more than ten other smaller cities. We
            currently offer almost thousand shorter educational programmes (up
            to 2 weeks), some 50 accredited longer adult educational programmes
            and 10 accredited higher educational study programmes /
            specializations.

            VMware, Adobe, Autodesk, EC-Council, (ISC)2 and others. We are

            qualifications, as well as all study programmes in higher education,
            are accredited by Ministry of Science and Education and are thus
            linked to European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

          <h2 id="text-1">Our business model</h2>
          <p>
            Algebra was built as a result of synergy created by numerous
            elements of the overall system. All those elements are focused on
            knowledge creation, use and dissemination. If we had to put our
            business strategy in just one sentence, it would be:
          </p>
          <p>
            Creation, dissemination and use of top quality applicable knowledge
