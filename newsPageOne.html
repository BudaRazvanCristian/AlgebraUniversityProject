            Join us for Croatia’s one of the first open-source hackathons,
            organized by Algebra University in partnership with DENT, a project
            by the Linux Foundation! This unique event will take place at the
            Algebra Spark Event Space in Zagreb on Saturday, December 14, 2024,
            from 8:00 to 20:00. With a prize fund of 3,000 EUR, the hackathon is
            designed for students and professionals eager to tackle challenges
            in network configuration and management. Seize the opportunity to
            collaborate with top experts, explore solutions for remote
            management, configuration resilience, and telemetry integration.
          </p>

          <h2 id="text-1">About DENT Project</h2>

          <p>
            As a Linux Foundation project, DENT utilizes the Linux Kernel,
            Switchdev, and other Linux-based projects as the foundation for
            building a new, standardized network operating system without
            abstractions or overhead. All underlying infrastructure — including
            ASIC and Silicon for networking and datapath — is treated equally,
            simplifying existing abstractions, APIs, drivers, low-level
            overhead, and other open-source software. DENT brings together
            silicon vendors, ODMs, SIs, OEMs, and end users from all sectors to
            enable the transition to disaggregated networks.
          </p>

          <h2 id="text-1">About the Event</h2>
          <p>
            One of the first open-source hackathons in Croatia, organized by
            Algebra University in collaboration with DENT, a Linux Foundation
            project. Participants, in teams of up to three members, will work on
            challenges such as cloud system management, remote packet capture,
            and telemetry improvement. This is a perfect chance to showcase your
            skills, innovate, and compete for valuable prizes.
          </p>

          <h2 id="text-1">Who is the Hackathon for?</h2>
          <p>
            The hackathon is open to students and IT professionals eager for
            challenges in networking technologies and collaboration with leading
            mentors. Participants will work on topics such as remote management,
            configuration resilience, and telemetry integration, aiming for
            innovation and the creation of solutions that push the boundaries of
            network systems. Whether you’re passionate about cloud-managed
            systems, remote packet capture, or telemetry enhancement, this is
            your chance to collaborate, innovate, and showcase your skills.
            Don’t miss the opportunity to delve into advanced network solutions
            and compete for significant prizes.
